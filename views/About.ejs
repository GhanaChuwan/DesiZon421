        <h3>About Us:</h3>
        <p>College is an expensive endeavor and students at Penn State University face financial challenges in terms of groceries, supplies and other necessary items. More importantly, our team consists of  international students, and it is even more challenging for international students who have moved to the US from countries all over the world for better opportunities. Students who do not have access to their own transportation have to use services like Instacart that home delivers groceries but at a hiked price or ask their friends for a ride to various stores to buy things they need or book Ubers or get the local bus transportation provided by the EMTA (Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority). Such methods prove very expensive and time consuming for the students. </p>

        <p>So we have decided to make a website DesiZon, which will provide essential products at discounted prices. From School Supplies to Groceries.</p>
